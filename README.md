### Real-time streamlit
This includes two tasks: 
1. Create a world clock that displays time in different locations around the world
2. Create a GitHub Action that runs a hello-world script periodically

## What's Included
- `app.py`: The file builds world clock frontend page.
- `hello.py`: The file prints "hello world".
- `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the Python dependencies for the project, which can be installed using `pip`.

## Lessoned learned
- I learned and practiced how to use Github Action for deploying script.
- I learned how to get the current time to build the clock app.

## Questions
- When I first try multi-select box in streamlit, it cannot delete the options when I click removing them, then I turned into four single select boxes.
